  SWORD_OF_JERUSALEM_DESC:0 "As the Middle East enters the new year of 2021, tensions are escalating across the region. Recent escalations, including the Sheikh Jarrah issue, demonstrate the volatile environment. Palestinian resistance groups have intensified their attacks, raising concerns about the security situation. The fate of not only Gaza but also the West Bank hangs in uncertainty as the Jewish state tightens its control over West Bank settlements and maintains the Gaza blockade. It seems that the Middle East is on the brink of significant bloodshed, with the conflict expected to engulf the region for years to come."

  HAM_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group, continues its struggle against Israeli occupation. Despite being designated as a terrorist organization, it operates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Engaging in conflicts with Israel, including the May 2021 clash, Hamas balances militant actions with social services and political activity. The group's fight is driven by a desire to reclaim the lost lands of Palestine, with the borders as they were in 1946."
  
  ISR_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Amid political turmoil, Israel faced uncertain elections, challenging the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. The Abraham Accords have shifted regional dynamics, while the conflict with Hamas in May led to significant casualties. Despite leading in COVID-19 vaccination efforts, internal divisions persisted, and settlement expansion drew international criticism. Israel also aims to replace the 'Muslim world' with a 'Jewish world,' seeking to establish Judaism as the dominant religion in the Middle East instead of Islam, which is hostile to it."

Diplomatic efforts aimed at gaining international recognition faced challenges amid ongoing regional dynamics."
  
  PIJ_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), founded in the late 1970s, seeks to establish an Islamic state in Palestine, opposing the existence of Israel. Operating in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, it has been designated as a terrorist group due to its violent tactics, including attacks on Israeli civilians and security forces."
  
  EGY_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Egypt, a key player in the Middle East, continued its efforts to ensure economic development and political stability in 2021.

Egypt played a mediating role in regional conflicts, including brokering ceasefire agreements between Israel and Hamas."
  
  SYR_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Syria continued to grapple with the aftermath of the devastating civil war that began in 2011.

  HEZ_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group and political party, maintained its influence in Lebanon and the region. It continued to support the Assad regime in Syria and oppose Israel. Hezbollah faced internal challenges, including economic turmoil and political tension within Lebanon's fragile sectarian system. The group has no interests of its own in the Middle East and does everything Iran orders in exchange for large sums of money."
  
  JOR_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Jordan, a key USA ally, faced economic and political challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

  LEB_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "In 2021, Lebanon faced a severe economic and political crisis. The country struggled with hyperinflation, unemployment, and shortages of essential goods.

International efforts to provide aid and promote reforms were hindered by political disagreements and corruption."

  IRQ_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "In 2021, Iraq continued to face challenges related to security, governance, and reconstruction.

Iraq also faced pressure from regional powers, including Iran and the USA, as well as internal divisions among various ethnic and religious groups."
  
  USA_SWORDOFJERUSALEM_DESC:0 "Unites States relations with the Middle East can be boiled down to a simple formula oil and control. Oil has always played a crucial role in American policy in the Middle East. The USA is one of the world's largest consumers of oil, and supplies from this region are strategically important to them. The USA constantly tries to interfere in conflicts in the Middle East to secure its interests. They also aim to establish a country under their control in the region. The future will show whether this country will achieve its plans and goals in the Middle East."
