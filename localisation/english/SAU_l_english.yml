Today, the family is mainly led by descendants of Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman, who established modern Saudi Arabia. They are a subgroup of the Banu Hanifa tribe. The most powerful member is the King of Saudi Arabia, who holds absolute authority. The family includes around 15,000 members, with approximately 2,000 holding the most power, wealth, and influence. Their combined wealth, including assets like Saudi Aramco, is estimated at $1.4 trillion, making them the richest family in history."
